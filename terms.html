<h2>SALE OF ELECTRICITY  </h2>

The designated areas will appear on the Site itself and may be expanded or reduced at the sole discretion of PPM without prior notice to the User.   
        </p>
       <p> The purchase of electricity via this Site is subject to any credit limitations or payment ceilings imposed by the User’s bank, and by the limits of the User’s electricity meter. Due to fixed service fees set by the local supply authority of electricity a minimum transaction amount would be applicable.  
        </p>
       <p> Although every effort is made to ensure that the User receives the purchased electricity immediately, PPM in no way warrants that the service will be completely uninterrupted and error free and that accordingly there may be a delay (time out) in the delivery of the electricity token to the User.  
        </p>

       <p>The User should contact PPM if the User’s meter will not accept the token but the meter number is correct.  
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>In the case where an electricity token number is not delivered within the 24 hour time frame and the User notifies PPM in writing at queries@ppmutilities.co.za within 24 hours of the 24 hour time frame expiring, then PPM will initiate a refund process.

If the User believes there has been any breach of security such as the disclosure, theft or unauthorised use of the User’s Password or any payment information, the User must notify PPM immediately.
